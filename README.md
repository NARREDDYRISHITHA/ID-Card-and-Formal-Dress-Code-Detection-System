# ID Card and Formal Dress Code Detection System

This project is a computer vision-based compliance monitoring system that detects ID card usage and verifies formal dress code adherence using a combination of YOLOv12 object detection and the Google Cloud Vision API. The system is integrated with automated email alerts and real-time violation logging for efficient monitoring.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **Real-Time ID Card Detection** using YOLOv8 (trained custom model)
- 👔 **Formal Dress Code Verification** using Google Cloud Vision API
- 📸 **Violation Monitoring & Evidence Capture**
- 📧 **Automated Email Alerts** with zipped violation images
- 🌐 **React-Based Web Interface** for monitoring & visualization

**Fig.4 Formal Dress Code Compliance Monitoring Flow**

1. Live video feed is analyzed in real-time.
2. ID card is detected using YOLOv8
3. Dress type is detected via Google Vision API.
4. If any violation (No ID / No Formal Dress) is found:
   - Captures the image
   - Saves to the appropriate folder
   - Sends an automated alert email with a .zip attachment

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8 with Ultralytics
- Google Cloud Vision API (Credentials required)
- Flask
- smtplib (for email)

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/formal-id-detection.git
cd formal-id-detection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add your Google Vision API credentials in dress.py

# Run the main script
python main.py
```

---

## 📫 Email Alert System
- Sends violation reports to the specified email ID.
- Emails include a `.zip` file containing images of non-compliant individuals.
- Example:

## 🛠️ Customization
- Change dress code logic in `dress.py`
- Update email list and SMTP settings in `send.py`
- Modify object detection threshold in `main.py`

---

## 📸 Model Training
- The YOLOv12 model was trained using custom dataset in `Id-card-1/`
- Use [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) or manual labeling tools for annotation
- Trained using `ultralytics` package:

```bash
yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov12.yaml data=data.yaml epochs=100 imgsz=640
```
